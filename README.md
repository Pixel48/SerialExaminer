## Why would you use it?
Good question! An maybe that's why this section is titled like that...

If you are teacher, or you just have to check several files with answers to some kind of test or exam with a lot of questions and specified answers - that would be something you might be interested!

### Where's the problem
Of course, you can take some time to correct these answers, but if you teach, for example, 5 classes with 30 students in class, and in every class you'll make test with 40 questions, **you'll have to compare 6000 checkboxes with exam key, _manually_**...

### Found problem, create a solution!
Let's suppose that your students can use computers to make .txt file with answers to test from .pdf file with questions, and then give it to you via pendrive after 15 minutes, and you now can select this pendrive in come kind of program, and in a snap get marks for these students!

***This is this software***
> Actually *will be*, when will be enough completed to work
