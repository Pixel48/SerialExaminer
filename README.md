## Introduction
  Most teachers check their students' knowledge through a list of questions with several answer options. This method is ok but it generates a lot of work. Hours of work. With SerialExaminer, these hours can become seconds, returning the wasted time

## Setup

### Windows
  To launch this project on your computer download and run proper installer form [last release][latest-release]

  `SerialExaminerSetup.exe` is 32-bit. For 64-bit systems, download `SerialExaminerSetup-x64.exe`
  To check how many bit your system is, check the system information in _System Settings_

  > Running downloaded installer will launch __[UAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control) *Unknown publisher* alert__ because it is not digitally signed - for now I can't afford digital certification. You can use [Virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to make sure that installer is clean

### Linux

  > First make sure your system  has installed [Python3](https://www.python.org)

  ```bash
  cd ~/Desktop
  git clone https://github.com/Pixel48/SerialExaminer.git
  cd SerialExaminer
  python3 SerialExaminer.py
  ```

## Usage
  A short guide how to use SerialExaminer

### Collecting answers
  Ask your students to send you test responses in .txt files named after their full names, journal number, any ID numbers or anything else, that can identify them. Ask them to write answers in these files in format `<question number>.<question answer>`, line by line. The order of questions and letter size don't matter

### Generating answer key
  1. Provide the exact number of questions and answers in the exam and Press `Create key` button
  2. Provide answers to questions about the question with given number. If you make a mistake you can go back using the `<` button. Window will disappear automatically after entering the last answer
  3. After key answer window vanish, press `Done` button and provide filename to save answer key for potential future use. Key is automatically imported after saving

### Importing answer key
  1. Press `Import` button
  2. In new dialog select key file you want to import

  You can import key from _.txt_ file, if it's formatted as a exam response

### Checking answers

  2. Press Browse button and provide folder with files written by your students
  3. Press Check button to calculate results
  4. Press Display button to show test results
  5. Press Export button, if you want to generate report file with result table in selected format
  > Future updates will add export options and predicted grade column in results
