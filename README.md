## Why would you use it?
Good question! An maybe that's why this section is titled like that...

If you are teacher, or you just have to check several files with answers to some kind of test or exam with a lot of questions and specified answers.

### Where's the problem
O course, you can take some time to correct these answers, but if you teach, for example, 5 classes with 30 students in class, and in every class you'll make test with 40 questions, **you'll have to compare 6000 boxes with exam key, _manually_**...

### Found problem, create a solution!
Let's suppose that your students can use computers to make .txt file with answers to test from .pdf file with questions, and then give it to you via pendrive after 15 minutes, and you now can select this pendrive in come kind of program, and in a snap get marks for these students!

***This is this software***
> Actually *will be*, when will be enough completed to work

## Usage
Nothing here, you can look for first alpha at my [trello table](https://trello.com/b/NcEXmMyl)

... but for now you can read some Lorem ipsum!
